"Which line has an error in this pseudocode?
1: count = 0
2: while(Table has rows)
3: Read row X
4: if(X.Score > 90)
5: count = count + Score
6: Move X to Table 2","Correct Answer: E) Line 5 – Score is undefined, should be X.Score"
"Identify incorrect lines in this pseudocode:
1: found = True
2: while(table has more rows and not found)
3: Read X
4: if X.ID == 101 then found = True",Correct Answer: A) Line 1 – Initialization should be False
"Find the error in the procedure call:
1: SumBB = 0
2: CountBB = 0
3: while (Pile has cards)
4: Read X
5: SumBB, CountBB = AddIfBigBazaar(X, SumBB)
6: Move X to Pile2","Correct Answer: E) Line 5 – Procedure expects 3 parameters, but only 2 provided"
"Spot the mistake:
1: SumBB = 0
2: CountBB = 0
3: while (Pile has cards)
4: Read X
5: SumBB, CountBB = AddIfBigBazaar(X, CountBB, SumBB)
6: Move X to Pile2",Correct Answer: E) Line 5 – Parameters passed in wrong order
"Which line contains an error?
1: Procedure Compute()
2: A = 0
3: Read X
4: A = A + Total
5: return A","Correct Answer: D) Line 4 – 'Total' is undefined, should be X.Total"
