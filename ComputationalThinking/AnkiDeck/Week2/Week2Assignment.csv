"Why is it common practice in pseudocode and many programming languages to use two different symbols for assignment and equality comparison (e.g., = for assignment and == for comparison)?<ul><li>a) To make the code longer and more explicit.</li><li>b) There is no logical reason; it is purely a historical convention.</li><li>c) To unambiguously distinguish between the action of setting a variable's value and the action of testing if a variable's value is equal to another value.</li><li>d) The == symbol is reserved for comparing text, while = is for numbers.</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> These are two fundamentally different operations. Assignment (=) is an action that changes the state of a variable. Comparison (==) is a question that returns a true or false answer without changing any state.
