"In the context of analyzing student relationships based on performance similarity, which statement most accurately defines a clique?<ul><li>a) In a clique, elements are connected by directed edges based on a mentoring relationship.</li><li>b) In a clique, elements are connected by undirected edges on the basis of their similarity.</li><li>c) A clique can only be formed between two elements at a time.</li><li>d) A clique represents a group where only one member is similar to all others.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A clique is a group where every member is mutually 'similar' to every other member. This symmetric 'similar' relationship is best represented by undirected edges.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) Directed edges represent asymmetric relationships, like mentoring, not mutual similarity.</li><li>c) A clique is a group and can consist of many elements (e.g., a triangle of 3, or larger groups), not just two.</li><li>d) The defining characteristic of a clique is that every member is connected to every other member, not just one central member.</li></ul>"

Each of the 'n' vertices connects to 'n-1' other vertices, giving n*(n-1) connections. Since each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects), we divide by 2.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) This would be the correct count for a directed clique where every pair has edges in both directions.</li><li>c) This would only be true for a path graph of n vertices, not a clique.</li><li>d) This formula does not represent the number of edges in a clique.</li></ul>"
"Consider an island with 15 telephone booths. According to graph theory principles (the handshaking lemma), is it possible to connect them with wires so that each telephone booth is connected to exactly 5 other booths?<ul><li>a) Yes, because the number of booths is divisible by 5.</li><li>b) No, because the sum of degrees would be odd.</li><li>c) Yes, as long as there are enough wires.</li><li>d) No, because 15 is an odd number of vertices.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The handshaking lemma states that the sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (an even number). In this case, the sum of degrees would be 15 booths * 5 connections/booth = 75.

"A 'mentoring' graph uses directed edges where A->B means A's score is significantly higher than B's. A 'similarity' graph uses undirected edges where A--B means their scores are very close. What is the fundamental difference in the relationships these two graph types represent?<ul><li>a) The mentoring relationship is symmetric, while similarity is asymmetric.</li><li>b) The mentoring graph must have fewer edges.</li><li>c) The mentoring relationship is asymmetric, while similarity is symmetric.</li><li>d) There is no fundamental difference.</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Mentoring is asymmetric (one-way), as A mentoring B does not imply B mentors A. Similarity is symmetric (two-way), as A being similar to B implies B is similar to A. Directed and undirected edges represent these properties, respectively.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This reverses the definitions of symmetric and asymmetric.</li><li>b) The number of edges depends on the data, not the type of relationship.</li><li>d) The directionality of the relationship is a fundamental difference.</li></ul>"

"A mentoring relationship is defined as effective only when the mentor's skill level is close enough to the learner's to appreciate their difficulties. Given this goal, why is it logical to use an upper bound (e.g., a 20-mark maximum difference) in addition to a lower bound when defining a mentoring edge in a graph?<ul><li>a) To ensure the mentor is not too far ahead to understand the learner's difficulties.</li><li>b) To save memory when creating the adjacency matrix.</li><li>c) To prevent the graph from becoming a clique.</li><li>d) To ensure the graph remains undirected.</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> If the skill gap is too large, the mentor may not be able to relate to or even understand the learner's specific problems. The upper bound ensures the knowledge levels are close enough for effective tutoring.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) The size of the matrix is determined by the number of students, not the number of edges.</li><li>c) The mentoring graph is directed and based on dissimilarity; an upper bound doesn't prevent or cause cliques.</li><li>d) The mentoring relationship is inherently directed; the bounds do not change this.</li></ul>"
"In a directed 'mentoring' graph where an edge A->B means A mentors B, 'in-degree' refers to the number of incoming edges.

In this mentoring graph, an incoming edge to student 'X' means another student can mentor 'X'.

"Why is a directed graph unsuitable for representing the 'student similarity' relationship?<ul><li>a) Because similarity must be represented with numbers, not edges.</li><li>b) Because if student A is similar to student B, it is implied that B is also similar to A.</li><li>c) Because a directed graph cannot have cliques.</li><li>d) Because directed graphs can only be used if scores are below 100.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Similarity is a symmetric property.

"A clique is also known by what other name in graph theory?<ul><li>a) A complete subgraph</li><li>b) A cycle</li><li>c) A path</li><li>d) A tree</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A clique is a subset of vertices of a graph where every two vertices in the subset are connected by an edge.

"A graph is built to find cliques of students who are similar. The initial rule for an edge to exist between two students is that they must be similar in all 3 subjects.

This will add more edges to the graph. With a denser graph (more edges), there is a higher probability of finding larger, fully connected subgraphs (cliques).<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) Weakening the condition for an edge to exist will always increase or maintain the number of edges, never decrease it.</li><li>c) The relationship is still symmetric, so the graph would remain undirected.</li><li>d) The number of students (vertices) remains the same regardless of the relationships between them.</li></ul>"
