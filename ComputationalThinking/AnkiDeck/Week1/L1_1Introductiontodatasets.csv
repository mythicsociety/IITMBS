"What are the datasets introduced in this lecture?<ul><li>a) Student Scores</li><li>b) Shopping Bills</li><li>c) Paragraph Words</li><li>d) All of the above</li></ul>";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The lectures use Student Scores, Shopping Bills, and Paragraph Words as the core examples to illustrate computational thinking concepts. The correct choice is 'All of the above' as it encompasses all three mentioned datasets.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This is partially correct, but not the most complete answer.</li><li>b) This is partially correct, but not the most complete answer.</li><li>c) This is partially correct, but not the most complete answer.</li></ul>"
"Which of the following is a question that cannot be asked using the “Scores” dataset?<ul><li>a) Who is the student with maximum marks in physics?</li><li>b) How many students scored more than 60 in mathematics?</li><li>c) How many students scored less than 40 in biology?</li><li>d) Who is the student with maximum marks in chemistry?</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The 'Scores' dataset is explicitly defined as containing marks only for Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. It does not contain any data for Biology, so questions about it cannot be answered.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This can be answered by iterating through the cards and finding the maximum physics mark.</li><li>b) This can be answered by iterating through the cards and counting those with a mathematics mark over 60.</li><li>d) This can be answered by iterating through the cards and finding the maximum chemistry mark.</li></ul>"
"What is a feature that is common to all datasets?<ul><li>a) The datasets have nothing in common</li><li>b) They all contain a 'Total' field</li><li>c) The cards in all three datasets have serial numbers</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The lectures point out that each card or record in all three example datasets is given a unique serial number to identify it, which is a common practice in data organization.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This is incorrect; the serial number is a common feature.</li><li>b) Only the Scores and Bills datasets have a 'Total' field.</li></ul>"
"What is the primary purpose of a 'variable' in the context of counting cards?<ul><li>a) To store the name of each student.</li><li>b) To hold a value that changes as we process each card, like a running count.</li><li>c) To represent the final, unchangeable total number of cards.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A variable is used to store intermediate values that change during a process. For counting, a 'count' variable is initialized to 0 and incremented for each card.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) While a variable could store a name, its primary purpose in this context is for counting.</li><li>c) The variable holds the count at every step; its final value is the total, but its nature is to be changeable.</li></ul>"
"In a flowchart, which symbol is used to ask a yes/no question that determines which path the process will take?<ul><li>a) A rectangle</li><li>b) A diamond</li><li>c) An oval</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The diamond shape is the standard symbol for a 'Decision' block in a flowchart, representing a point where the flow branches based on a condition.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A rectangle represents a 'Process' or an action to be taken.</li><li>c) An oval represents a 'Terminal' point, such as Start or End.</li></ul>"
"What is the first step in the process of 'iteration' for summing the marks on a set of cards?<ul><li>a) Pick the first card and read its mark.</li><li>b) Initialize a 'sum' variable to 0.</li><li>c) Check if there are any cards left.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Before starting the loop (the repetition), the process must be initialized. For summing, this involves setting up a variable to hold the running total, starting at 0.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This is an action performed inside the loop, not the initial setup step.</li><li>c) This is the condition check for the loop, which happens after initialization.</li></ul>"
"If you want to find the average math score for only the boys in the 'Scores' dataset, what concepts are you combining?<ul><li>a) Variables and Flowcharts</li><li>b) Iteration and Filtering</li><li>c) Datasets and Subtypes</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> You must iterate through all the cards to check each one, and you must filter them to only process the cards where the gender is 'Male'.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) While you would use variables and could represent this with a flowchart, the core computational patterns are iteration and filtering.</li><li>c) While you are using a dataset and the data has types, these are not the actions you are performing.</li></ul>"
"What is the definition of a 'data type'?<ul><li>a) It describes the color and font of data on a card.</li><li>b) It defines the allowed values for a piece of data and the operations that can be performed on it.</li><li>c) It is a complex diagram showing how data is organized.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A data type is a fundamental concept that constrains data, ensuring its sanity by defining what it can be (e.g., a number between 0-100) and what can be done with it (e.g., it can be added).<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This describes visual styling, not the logical nature of the data.</li><li>c) This is a vague description; a data type is a formal classification, not a diagram.</li></ul>"
"A single 'Student Score' card, which bundles together fields like Name (String), City (String), and Maths Marks (Integer), is an example of what kind of data type?<ul><li>a) A List</li><li>b) A Subtype</li><li>c) A Record</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A Record (or struct) is a complex data type that groups together multiple fields, which can be of different data types, under one structure.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A List is a sequence of items, typically of the same type (like a list of Records).</li><li>b) A Subtype is a more constrained version of a basic type, not a collection of different fields.</li></ul>"
"Consider the following flowchart for summing the math marks of only the boys:<br><pre>Start -> Initialize BoySum = 0 -> Are there more cards?
  If Yes -> Pick Card X
    -> Is Card X a boy?
      If Yes -> Add CardX's Math score to BoySum
      If No -> [Do Nothing]
    -> Move Card X to Pile 2 -> Loop back to 'Are there more cards?'
  If No -> End</pre>What happens if the card picked is for a girl?<ul><li>a) The process ends immediately.</li><li>b) The girl's math score is added to the BoySum.</li><li>c) The card is skipped for summing and the process moves to the next card.</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The flowchart shows a decision ('Is Card X a boy?'). If the answer is 'No', the path bypasses the addition step and goes straight to moving the card and looping back, effectively ignoring it for the sum.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) The process only ends when there are no more cards in the initial pile.</li><li>b) The condition explicitly prevents this; only boys' scores are added.</li></ul>"
"Creating a 'Marks' data type from the 'Integer' type, but restricting its values to be between 0 and 100, is an example of creating a:<ul><li>a) Record</li><li>b) List</li><li>c) Subtype</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A subtype is a more specific version of a basic data type with additional constraints. In this case, the range of allowed integer values is restricted.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A record is a collection of different fields, not a constrained version of a single type.</li><li>b) A list is a sequence of items, not a constrained version of a single type.</li></ul>"
"The entire stack of 'Student Score' cards, treated as a single sequence of records, is an example of what kind of data type?<ul><li>a) A List</li><li>b) A Record</li><li>c) An Integer</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A list is a data type that represents an ordered sequence of other data items. In this case, it's a list of 'Student Score' records.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) A single card is a record; the whole stack is a list of them.</li><li>c) An integer is a basic data type for whole numbers.</li></ul>"
