"In the student mentoring scenario, where a student can mentor another if their mark is 10 to 20 points higher, is it possible for Student A to mentor Student B, and for Student B to mentor Student C, all within the same subject?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This describes a path A -> B -> C. This is possible as long as the mark conditions are met for each step (e.g., A has 90, B has 75, C has 60). This is different from a cycle, which is impossible in a single subject.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) This statement is true. The scenario describes a valid sequence of mentoring relationships, not a logical contradiction.</li></ul>"
"In the student mentoring scenario, is it possible for Student A to mentor Student B in one subject (e.g., Maths), and for Student B to mentor Student A in a different subject (e.g., Physics)?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This is the fundamental concept of a 2-person study group discussed in the lecture. It requires Student A to have a higher score in one subject and Student B to have a higher score in another, which is a common and possible scenario.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) This is a key mechanism for forming study groups and is explicitly described as possible in the lecture materials.</li></ul>"
"In a directed graph representing mentoring relationships, what is the minimum number of nodes (students) required to form a cycle?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A cycle requires a path that starts and ends at the same node. The smallest possible cycle involves two nodes, A and B, with edges A -> B and B -> A. A single node cannot form a cycle with itself in this context.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A single node cannot have an edge pointing to itself in the mentoring scenario, as the mark difference would be 0.</li><li>c) While a 3-node cycle is possible, it is not the minimum. A 2-node cycle is smaller.</li><li>d) Four nodes are not the minimum required.</li></ul>"
"In the student mentoring scenario, is it possible for a cycle of three students (A -> B -> C -> A) to be formed if they are all being mentored in the same single subject?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This is impossible. For this cycle to exist in one subject, it would require Marks(A) > Marks(B), Marks(B) > Marks(C), and Marks(C) > Marks(A). This creates a logical contradiction where a student's mark must be greater than itself.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This statement is false due to the logical impossibility of A > B > C > A.</li></ul>"
"Consider a directed graph where a large cycle exists, such as A -> B -> C -> D -> A. If an additional direct edge from C to A also exists, does this create a new, smaller cycle within the original structure?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Yes. The path A -> B -> C combined with the new direct edge C -> A forms a new, self-contained cycle (A -> B -> C -> A) that exists within the larger connection pattern.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) The addition of the edge C -> A creates a shortcut, forming a valid, smaller cycle. It does not break any graph theory rules.</li></ul>"
"Between two students, A and B, and across three subjects (Maths, Physics, Chemistry), what is the maximum number of distinct 2-step study cycles (where A mentors B in one subject and B mentors A in another) that can possibly be formed?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A 2-cycle requires two different subjects. Let's list the possibilities for the (A->B subject, B->A subject) pairs: (Maths, Physics), (Maths, Chemistry), (Physics, Maths), (Physics, Chemistry), (Chemistry, Maths), and (Chemistry, Physics). This gives a total of 6 distinct possible cycles.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) 3 is too few; it only accounts for pairs of subjects, not the direction of mentoring.</li><li>c) 9 is too many; there are only 3 choices for the first edge and 2 for the second, leading to 3*2=6 combinations.</li><li>d) 12 is incorrect.</li></ul>"
"In a class of 30 students, assume the mentoring rule is simplified: a student can mentor anyone with a strictly lower score, regardless of the difference. What is the maximum number of mentoring relationships (either mentoring or being mentored) a single student can have across all 3 subjects?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A student can have a relationship with the 29 other students in the class. For each of these 29 students, a mentoring relationship (in either direction) could potentially exist in each of the 3 subjects. Therefore, the maximum number of possible relationship instances connected to one student is 29 * 3.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A student cannot mentor or be mentored by themselves, so the calculation must be based on 29 other students, not 30.</li><li>c) This incorrectly assumes there are only 28 other students.</li><li>d) This incorrectly assumes there are only 27 other students.</li></ul>"
"When representing a directed graph of student relationships using an adjacency matrix M, what does the entry M[i][j] = 0 signify?";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> In the 0/1 matrix representation discussed, a '1' indicates the presence of an edge, and a '0' indicates its absence. Therefore, M[i][j] = 0 means there is no direct edge (relationship) from student i to student j.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) An edge from j to i would be represented by M[j][i] = 1.</li><li>b) An edge from i to j would be represented by M[i][j] = 1.</li><li>d) A value of 0 indicates the lack of a relationship, not the presence of one.</li></ul>"
"Given the following pseudocode:<br><pre>Procedure CreateMentorGraph(marks)\n  n = length(keys(marks))\n  mentorGraph = CreateMatrix(n,n)\n  foreach i in keys(marks) {\n    foreach j in keys(marks) {\n      ijMarksDiff = marks[i] - marks[j]\n      if (10 <= ijMarksDiff and ijMarksDiff <= 20) {\n        mentorGraph[i][j] = 1\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return(mentorGraph)\nEnd Procedure</pre>What is the primary purpose of the line mentorGraph[i][j] = 1?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This line is executed only when the condition for mentoring is met. In the matrix representation of the graph, setting the value at [i][j] to 1 creates a directed edge from node i to node j, signifying that 'i can mentor j'.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) This would be represented by mentorGraph[j][i] = 1.</li><li>c) The procedure is creating a graph representing relationships, not calculating a score.</li><li>d) The value '1' signifies the presence of an edge, not its weight or strength.</li></ul>"
"In the context of the lecture, two students are defined as 'similar' if the absolute difference of their marks is less than 10 (i.e., 0-9 marks). For a 'similarity' edge to be drawn between them, what additional condition must be met?";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The lecture defines similarity as a holistic measure. The condition of having a mark difference of less than 10 must be true for all three subjects (Maths, Physics, AND Chemistry) simultaneously.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This is insufficient; the rule applies to all subjects, not just one.</li><li>b) This is also insufficient.</li><li>c) The relationship is symmetric (undirected), so if A is similar to B, B is similar to A. There's no directional condition.</li></ul>"
"In an undirected graph where an edge represents 'similarity' between two students, what defines a 'clique' of size 4?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the subset. For a clique of size 4, this means each of the 4 students must be similar to the other 3, resulting in a fully connected subgraph among them.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This describes a path or a cycle, not a clique. A clique requires all possible connections, not just a loop.</li><li>c) A single student connected to 4 others does not guarantee those 4 are connected to each other.</li><li>d) This describes a 'star' formation, not a clique.</li></ul>"
"According to the lecture's discussion on popularity (defined by the number of unique mentors), why would a student with the highest marks in all subjects likely have a popularity score of 0?";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Popularity is defined by the number of incoming mentoring edges. A student with the highest marks cannot be mentored by anyone, as no other student will have a score that is 10-20 points higher. Therefore, their in-degree is 0.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) They would have a very high out-degree (can mentor many), but this is not how popularity was defined.</li><li>b) The number of subjects is irrelevant if no one can meet the criteria to mentor them.</li><li>d) The similarity graph is based on a different concept and is not used for this popularity calculation.</li></ul>"
"What is the fundamental difference in the type of graph edge used for the 'mentoring' relationship versus the 'similarity' relationship?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The mentoring relationship is directional: 'A mentors B' is not the same as 'B mentors A'. This is represented by a directed edge (an arrow). The similarity relationship is reciprocal: 'A is similar to B' implies 'B is similar to A'. This is represented by an undirected edge (a line).<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) This is incorrect. Mentoring is directed, similarity is undirected.</li><li>c) This is incorrect.</li><li>d) Both relationships can have labels (e.g., subject for mentoring), but the core difference is their directionality.</li></ul>"
"In the procedure to find pairs for study groups, the code checks if (mathMentorGraph[i][j] == 1 and phyMentorGraph[j][i] == 1). Why does it check for an edge from i to j in one graph, but from j to i in the other?";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The goal is to find a reciprocal relationship for a study group. The condition mathMentorGraph[i][j] == 1 checks if 'i can mentor j in Maths'. The condition phyMentorGraph[j][i] == 1 checks if 'j can mentor i in Physics'. Together, they confirm a 2-person study cycle.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) It's checking for a reciprocal relationship, not the same one in two subjects.</li><li>b) This describes finding a 3-person study group, which requires a different logic.</li><li>c) This would only confirm that i can mentor j in both subjects, which isn't a reciprocal study group.</li></ul>"
"Why is it logically impossible for a 'mentoring' edge and a 'similarity' edge to exist between the same two students (A and B) for the same subject?";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The conditions are mutually exclusive. Mentoring requires a mark difference of at least 10. Similarity requires a mark difference of less than 10. A single pair of marks cannot satisfy both conditions at the same time.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) The rules are based on specific mark differences, making them mutually exclusive.</li><li>b) The graph types are different, but the underlying logical contradiction is the reason.</li><li>d) This is incorrect; the rules are explicitly defined and contradictory.</li></ul>"
"In the train route graph, stations are nodes and direct trains are edges. If you want to travel from Bangalore to Kanpur and the graph shows no direct edge between them, what must you look for in the graph?";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> If there is no direct edge, you must find an indirect route. This means finding a sequence of connected edges, or a path, that leads from the 'Bangalore' node to the 'Kanpur' node, possibly through one or more intermediate station nodes.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) A cycle would bring you back to your starting point, which is not the goal of traveling to a new destination.</li><li>c) A clique is a concept related to fully connected subgraphs and is not relevant to finding a route between two specific points.</li><li>d) A disconnected component would imply it's impossible to get from one to the other. You must first search for a path.</li></ul>"
"In the analysis of the Swaminathan paragraph, nouns and pronouns were represented as nodes. What did a 'disconnected' graph (a graph with two or more separate groups of nodes with no paths between them) signify about the paragraph's structure?";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A connected graph implies that all concepts (nouns) are related and flow together. A disconnected graph indicates that the paragraph is discussing two or more unrelated topics or ideas that do not link, suggesting a lack of coherence.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A well-structured paragraph should be connected, not disconnected.</li><li>b) The number of verbs is not directly what a disconnected graph measures; it measures the coherence of the nouns.</li><li>c) A single topic should result in a connected graph.</li></ul>"
"The lecture introduces rows(m) and columns(m) as convenient shorthands for iterating through a matrix m. To ensure a predictable, ordered processing (e.g., 0, 1, 2...), what underlying functions do these shorthands represent?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The lecture explains that dictionary keys are not inherently ordered. To process them sequentially, one must first get the list of keys and then sort them. So, rows(m) is a shorthand for sort(keys(m)).<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) Simply getting the keys is not enough as their order is arbitrary.</li><li>c) There is no order() function; sorting is the required operation.</li><li>d) The matrix is implemented as a dictionary, so keys() is the correct function to get the indices.</li></ul>"
"The lecture presented two pseudocodes for calculating popularity. What was the flaw in the first, simpler version that the second, more accurate version corrected?<br><pre>-- Flawed Version --\npopularity[i] = 0\nforeach j in keys(mathMarks) {\n if (mathMentorGraph[j][i] == 1) { popularity[i]++ }\n if (phyMentorGraph[j][i] == 1) { popularity[i]++ }\n if (chemMentorGraph[j][i] == 1) { popularity[i]++ }\n}</pre>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The flawed version increments the popularity counter for each subject. If the same student j can mentor student i in both Maths and Physics, popularity[i] would be incremented twice for the same mentor. The corrected version uses a dictionary to store unique mentors before counting them.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) The code iterates correctly; the flaw is in the counting logic.</li><li>c) It correctly checks for incoming edges ([j][i]), not outgoing.</li><li>d) It correctly calculates popularity for i, not j.</li></ul>"
"In the CreateSimilarityGraph procedure, the condition is if (ijDiff1 < 10 and ijDiff2 < 10 and ijDiff3 < 10). Why must this and condition be met for all three subjects?";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> The definition of 'similar students' in the lecture is strict: they must be performing at a comparable level across the board. Therefore, the mark difference must be small in every subject, not just one or two.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) Using or would mean students are 'similar' even if they have a huge mark difference in two subjects, which violates the concept.</li><li>b) The procedure is creating an undirected graph, but this is the reason for the and.</li><li>c) The goal is to find overall similarity, not similarity in just one area.</li></ul>"
"In the context of finding study groups, what is the significance of discovering a directed cycle of length 3, such as (A -> B in Maths), (B -> C in Physics), (C -> A in Chemistry)?";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This represents a stable, mutually beneficial 3-person study group. Each student in the cycle is both mentoring someone and being mentored by someone else, ensuring that everyone contributes and everyone benefits from the arrangement.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) This is a valid and desirable outcome, representing a functional study group.</li><li>c) A clique is a concept from an undirected similarity graph, not the directed mentoring graph.</li><li>d) This is a key pattern to find, not an error. It's a primary goal of the graph analysis.</li></ul>"
