"According to the lecture's definition, what is the primary criterion for identifying a 'popular' student within the mentorship graph?<ul><li>a) The student should have the highest number of mentors (maximum in-degree).</li><li>b) The student should mentor the highest number of other students (maximum out-degree).</li><li>c) The student should have an equal number of mentors and students they mentor.</li><li>d) The student should have the highest number of unique neighbors they can interact with.</li></ul>";"Correct: d)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A popular student is one who is highly connected within the academic network. This is measured by the total number of unique students they can either mentor or be mentored by. This corresponds to the highest number of neighbors (or total degree) in the graph, where duplicates are handled to count each neighbor only once, regardless of the number of subjects involved.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A student with the highest number of mentors might simply have the lowest marks, not necessarily be popular.</li><li>b) A student who mentors the most people likely has the highest marks (e.g., 'Rahul' in the lecture), giving them a high out-degree but a zero in-degree, which is not the definition of popular.</li><li>c) An equal in-degree and out-degree is not the specified criterion for popularity.</li></ul>"
"In the context of the mentorship graph for a single subject, if a student cannot be mentored by anyone, what can be definitively concluded about their marks?<ul><li>a) The student has the highest marks in that subject.</li><li>b) The student has the lowest marks in that subject.</li><li>c) The student's marks are exactly 10 points above the next highest student.</li><li>d) The student did not take the exam for that subject.</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A student can be mentored only if another student has marks that are 10 to 20 points higher. If a student has the highest marks in the subject, no other student has higher marks, making it impossible for them to be mentored. Therefore, their in-degree for that subject will be zero.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) A student with the lowest marks would likely have many potential mentors, not zero.</li><li>c) The specific mark difference is not relevant; having the highest score is the definitive reason.</li><li>d) The student must have a score to be included in the graph analysis.</li></ul>"
"In the mentorship graph for a specific subject, what is the most likely reason a student is unable to mentor any other student?<ul><li>a) The student has the highest marks in that subject.</li><li>b) The student has the lowest marks in that subject.</li><li>c) The difference in marks between that student and every other student is less than 10.</li><li>d) The student is already part of a full study group.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> To mentor someone, a student must have marks that are 10 to 20 points higher than the other student. If a student has the lowest marks, there is no one with lower marks for them to mentor. This results in an out-degree of zero for that subject.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) A student with the highest marks would likely be able to mentor many students.</li><li>c) While having a mark difference of less than 10 with everyone would also prevent mentoring, having the absolute lowest marks is a more certain and direct cause.</li><li>d) The graph construction is independent of existing study group assignments.</li></ul>"
"Why is a student with very high marks in all subjects generally not considered 'popular' under the lecture's definition, despite being able to mentor many others?<ul><li>a) Their marks are too high to form any connections in the graph.</li><li>b) Popularity is a measure reserved only for students with average marks.</li><li>c) They typically have a high out-degree but a very low (or zero) in-degree.</li><li>d) The algorithm cannot process students at the extreme ends of the mark spectrum.</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Popularity is defined by a balance of interactionsâ€”both mentoring and being mentored. A student with top marks can help many others (high out-degree) but cannot be mentored by anyone (zero in-degree). This makes their relationships one-sided. Truly 'popular' students are often in the middle, fostering a greater number of two-way interactions.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) They can form many outgoing connections (mentoring), so this is incorrect.</li><li>b) Popularity is not explicitly reserved for average students, but students in the middle are more likely to achieve it due to the mechanics of in-degree and out-degree.</li><li>d) The algorithm processes all students regardless of their marks.</li></ul>"
"Given the following pseudocode for calculating popularity:<br><pre>mentors = {}
popularity = {}

}</pre>In this pseudocode, a nested dictionary mentors[j] is used to keep track of who can mentor student j. What is the primary purpose of using a dictionary here instead of a simple list or counter?<ul><li>a) To automatically handle and prevent counting the same mentor multiple times if they can mentor in more than one subject.</li><li>b) To store the subject in which the mentoring relationship exists.</li><li>c) To significantly increase the speed of the calculation compared to a list.</li><li>d) To allow for mentors to be identified by non-numeric keys.</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> A single student i might be able to mentor student j in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. A simple counter would add 1 for each case, incorrectly inflating j's popularity. By using a dictionary (mentors[j]) and setting a key for each mentor (mentors[j][i] = True), we ensure that mentor i is counted only once. The final popularity is the number of unique keys: length(keys(mentors[j])).<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) The pseudocode now shown does not store the subject, only the mentor's identity as a key.</li><li>c) The primary goal is correctness (avoiding duplicates), not speed, although dictionaries are efficient for lookups.</li><li>d) Student IDs are the keys, which are typically numeric or string-based; the choice of a dictionary is for its unique key property.</li></ul>"
"What do the 'in-degree' and 'out-degree' of a node (representing a student) signify in the directed mentorship graph?<ul><li>a) In-degree is the number of subjects a student excels at; out-degree is the number of subjects they are weak in.</li><li>b) In-degree is the count of students who can mentor them; out-degree is the count of students they can mentor.</li><li>c) In-degree is the student's overall rank; out-degree is their total number of connections.</li><li>d) In-degree and out-degree are summed up to calculate a student's final grade.</li></ul>";"Correct: b)";"<b>Explanation:</b> In a directed graph, the 'in-degree' of a node is the number of edges pointing to it. In this context, it represents the number of students who can mentor that student. The 'out-degree' is the number of edges pointing away from the node, representing the number of students that student can mentor.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) Degrees relate to connections between students, not a student's individual subject performance.</li><li>c) Rank is not represented by degree, and total connections (neighbors) is a combination of in-degree and out-degree.</li><li>d) Graph degrees are unrelated to academic grades.</li></ul>"

"A student is described as 'popular' if they are in the 'middle' of the academic performance spectrum. Why does this position tend to result in a higher popularity score?<ul><li>a) They have marks high enough to mentor some students and simultaneously low enough to be mentored by others.</li><li>b) The popularity algorithm is specifically designed to give extra weight to students with average scores.</li><li>c) Their central position in the mark distribution means they are directly connected to every other student.</li><li>d) Their marks are guaranteed to be within 10 points of every other student.</li></ul>";"Correct: a)";"<b>Explanation:</b> Popularity stems from having a high number of unique neighbors. Students in the middle are best positioned for this: their marks are lower than the top performers (allowing for incoming mentor connections) and higher than the bottom performers (allowing for outgoing mentor connections). This maximizes the potential for both in-degree and out-degree, leading to a higher total number of connections.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>b) The algorithm is impartial; it only counts connections based on mark differences. The effect is emergent, not programmed.</li><li>c) They are not necessarily connected to everyone, just that they have the potential for the most connections.</li><li>d) This is incorrect; their marks must be different by at least 10 to form any mentoring connection.</li></ul>"
"What is the ultimate goal of analyzing the mentorship graph to identify 'popular' students, from a network analysis perspective?<ul><li>a) To create a definitive ranking of all students from best to worst academically.</li><li>b) To find students who require the most academic assistance.</li><li>c) To identify socially and academically central students who can act as key connectors or hubs in the network.</li><li>d) To prove that students with average marks are the most important.</li></ul>";"Correct: c)";"<b>Explanation:</b> This exercise is a form of social network analysis. Identifying 'popular' students is about finding the central nodes or 'hubs' in the student interaction network. These individuals are important because they bridge connections between different groups of students, facilitating the flow of information and study opportunities. Their importance is based on their connectivity, not just their academic rank.<br><b>Distractor Rationale:</b><ul><li>a) The analysis is about connections, not creating a simple academic leaderboard.</li><li>b) Students needing help would have a high in-degree but not necessarily be 'popular' if their out-degree is zero.</li><li>d) The goal is to identify central connectors, not to make a value judgment about the importance of average marks.</li></ul>"
