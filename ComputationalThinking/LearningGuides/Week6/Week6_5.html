                <p class="text-lg">Welcome to this guide on one of the most powerful applications of computational thinking: systematically verifying a hypothesis. We often have ideas or theories about our data—for example, "students who are good at Maths are also good at Physics" or "adjectives are usually followed by nouns." But how can we prove or disprove these ideas rigorously?</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">This is where lists become incredibly useful. We can use them to systematically collect evidence that either **confirms** or **refutes** our hypothesis. By analyzing the size of these evidence lists, we can make a data-driven conclusion about whether our initial idea holds true. Let's dive into the process.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800">What is a Hypothesis?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">A hypothesis is simply a proposed explanation or a claim made on the basis of limited evidence, which can then be tested. In our context, it's a statement about a pattern we think might exist in our data.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">Examples of hypotheses we can test with our datasets:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 mt-2 pl-4">
                    <li><strong>From the "Scores" dataset:</strong> "Students with high marks in Mathematics also have high marks in Physics."</li>
                    <li><strong>From the "Paragraph Words" dataset:</strong> "Adjectives are followed by nouns."</li>
                    <li><strong>From the "Paragraph Words" dataset:</strong> "Words starting with a vowel are usually followed by words starting with a consonant."</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">The key is that a hypothesis must be testable. We need a clear, systematic way to go through the data and check each relevant instance against our claim.</p>

                <p class="text-lg mb-4">To verify a hypothesis, we don't rely on gut feelings. We use a systematic process involving two lists to collect evidence:</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800">Analyzing the Results</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Once we have populated our `confirmList` and `refuteList`, we can analyze them to reach a conclusion. The most straightforward way to do this is by comparing their lengths.</p>
                <div class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-6 rounded-lg font-mono">
                    <p>X = length(confirmList)</p>
                    <p>Y = length(refuteList)</p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">The sum `X + Y` gives us the total number of times we tested the hypothesis (i.e., the total number of adjectives in the dataset).</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">We can then calculate percentages to quantify the result:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2 mt-2 pl-4">
                    <li><strong>Confirmation Percentage:</strong> `(X / (X + Y)) * 100`</li>
                    <li><strong>Refutation Percentage:</strong> `(Y / (X + Y)) * 100`</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">If the confirmation percentage is very high (e.g., 90%), we can say our hypothesis is strongly supported. If it's low (e.g., 20%), our hypothesis is strongly refuted. If it's around 50%, the pattern is likely random.</p>

                    <li><strong>Formulate a Testable Claim:</strong> Start with a clear, specific hypothesis about a pattern in your data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collect Evidence Systematically:</strong> Iterate through the data and use conditional logic to populate a `confirm` list (for supporting evidence) and a `refute` list (for contradicting evidence).</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze with `length()`:</strong> The lengths of the `confirm` and `refute` lists provide a quantitative measure of the evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Draw a Conclusion:</strong> Calculate percentages to determine the strength of support for your hypothesis. This is a much more rigorous approach than simple observation.</li>
