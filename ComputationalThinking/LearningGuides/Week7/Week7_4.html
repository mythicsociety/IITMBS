                <p class="text-lg">Welcome! In this lesson, we shift our focus from individual data points to understanding the relationships *between* them. A common goal for businesses is to find groups of similar customers, a process known as <strong>customer segmentation</strong>. This allows them to tailor marketing, offers, and product recommendations more effectively.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">We'll explore a computational approach to determine how "similar" two customers are by analyzing their shopping bills. This involves aggregating their purchase data and then calculating a "distance" between them to quantify their relationship.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800">Step 1: Data Aggregation</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Raw shopping bills are too detailed for direct comparison. The first crucial step is to aggregate the data into a standardized format. We can use a dictionary to process all the bills for each customer and create a summary table.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800">Creating a Customer Profile Table</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mt-2">The goal is to create a table where:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mt-2 pl-4 space-y-2">
                        <li>Each <strong>row</strong> represents a unique customer.</li>
                        <li>Each <strong>column</strong> represents a purchase category (e.g., Apparel, Food, Toiletries).</li>
                        <li>The <strong>value</strong> in each cell is the total number of items the customer bought in that category across all their bills.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-lg mt-2">This process transforms a large, messy collection of bills into a clean, structured table that is ready for analysis.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800">Step 2: Measuring Similarity with "Distance"</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">How can we numerically define "similarity"? In data analysis, a common way is to calculate the <strong>distance</strong> between two data points. The concept is simple:</p>
                <div class="mt-4 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 bg-gray-50">
                    <p class="text-lg">If the distance between two customers is <strong>low</strong>, they are <strong>more similar</strong>. If the distance is <strong>high</strong>, they are <strong>less similar</strong>.</p>

                <div class="mt-6">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">The "Manhattan Distance" Method</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg mt-2">A straightforward way to calculate this distance is to sum the absolute differences for each category:</p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-lg space-y-2 mt-2 pl-4">
                        <li>For each category (column), find the absolute difference between the number of items purchased by Customer A and Customer B.</li>
                        <li>Sum up all these differences.</li>
                        <li>The final sum is the total distance between the two customers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md mt-2"><code>Distance = |Apparel_A - Apparel_B| + |Food_A - Food_B| + |Toil_A - Toil_B| + ...</code></pre>

                    correct: ["Aggregate individual purchase data into a summary table."],
                    explanation: "Before any comparison can happen, the raw data from many bills must be aggregated into a consistent format, like a table of items per category for each customer."
